# GoogleOrShutdown

## Description
This is a simple python and powershell script that restarts the computer when you google.
If the powershell script is executed when the computer restarts, you can't google anymore.

## shutdown.py
You don't need shutdown.py because it's already base64-encoded in execute.ps1.
